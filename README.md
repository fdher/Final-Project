# Final-Project

For this project, I worked with a Dataframe that recollected data from corners in Mexico City from 2018 - 2019. The questions that lead me to use a machine learning alghoritm where:

What factors influence a hit and run in Mexico? 
What are the metrics behind this?
What would be the possible solution to this problem?

I used Random Forest Classifier with hyperparameter tunning, allowing me to obtain an accuracy of 84%. After this I used Tableu for elaborating a story and showing the data in a more friendly manner.
